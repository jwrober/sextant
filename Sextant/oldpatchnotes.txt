Bugfix: removed misc/shields file reference from tilespecs
GTK2 Bug: Top-Right/Bottom-Left shoreside ocean corners not appearing(also in Trident, probable draw bug? R010 appears to be using R000[I assume left has the same issue]<Qt does not appear to have this issue><also not present in 2.5.4>)
terrain.spec: referenced desert embellishments
grid.png: replaced white and black grid lines with white-and-black, transparent, less invasive gridlines
