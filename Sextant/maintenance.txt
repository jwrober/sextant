shields-flag.spec:
 sextant/flags.spec is a copy of the one in misc/flags.spec with
  the "f." entries replaced with "f.shield." for use as units shields

 if new flags are added, the new misc/flags.spec can be copy/pasted into
  data/sextant and the "f." entries replaced with "f.shield." entries
  and the override at the bottom should be changed to:
*include "sextant/shields-flag-override.spec"

shields-flag-override.spec:
 if override flags are added, the new override/flags.spec can be
  copy/pasted, renamed to shields-flag-override.spec, and
  cut/pasted into data/sextant and the "f." entries replaced with
  "f.shield." entries
